# OSGI-Declarative-Service-UI
UI for analyzing declartive services within the OSGi runtime platform.

The current implementation works with Equinox Declarative Services and ecf generic server from the Eclipse Communication Framework.

Official OSGi DTOs have been modified to be serializable but follow the original class structure.
